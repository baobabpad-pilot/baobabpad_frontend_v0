          High costs associated with technology development are a major barrier
          for startups and growth companies. Founders and business developers
          struggle to balance the need for user validation and a minimum viable
          product (MVP) with the financial burden of building it. This is a
          fight or flight mode for many founders as they calculate their chances
          of building a company. Statistically, we all know that, ‘90% failure
          rate of startups and many reasons to back this. From product lack of
          market fitness to, late in the game and a plethora of conflicts
          internally we focus on the market, and many more reasons.

          As the venture capital world is winding down investing in early
          starts, this will be a major hurdle. However, you only need venture
          capital to address some pressing issues in your business scaffold for
          elevation, if the product has market need and market fitness don’t
          bother going to investors, build on cashflow and sales to finance your
          growth (organically). The challenge of early fundraising is that you
          give up too much diluting equity, a major concern for early-stage
          startups. And investors who are only seeking a 10X return on
          investment, are not a good options for early startups, remember this
          is a business just starting to bud from petals, will be a solid branch
          some 10 years away. Investors who also act as advisors in your growth
          journey are the best investment and financing partners.
