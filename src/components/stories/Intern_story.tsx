            I am Pascaline Uwase from Kigali, Rwanda, junior developer at Baobabpad. I joined Baobabpad as an intern working remotely from Kigali, Rwanda and now I am a junior developer. Upon joining Baobabpad, my experience with tech was far less extensive than it is currently. 
                <br/><br/>
            I began by learning how to understand client needs through user personas.This is accomplished by determining demographics, objectives, attitudes, behaviors, pain points, wants, and a host of other details about the clients or users. All of this information helped me to understand the elements I needed to include in the design of the product I was about to create.

             Secondly, I gained experience using Figma for design creation. Learning was significantly enhanced with the help of my mentor and remote teams. It becomes easier when you understand user personas because it puts you in the users' shoes and improves the quality of your work.
             <br/><br/>
             After this, I learned new programming languages and frameworks, such as Next.js. I participated in developing new websites, which also provided valuable experience in teamwork. I am currently undergoing continuous learning sponsored by Baobabpad in different technology languages including AI. 
             <br/><br/>
             As a result, I can now code confidently. I'm glad I acquired this skill, and I'm committed to continuous learning to become a more professional developer and contribute to the development of my community and Africa at large.

            <li>Understanding User Personas: I grasped the importance of user personas in creating effective designs. By considering demographics, goals, and pain points, I am able to design websites that truly cater to user needs.</li>
             <li>Figma Expertise: I gained proficiency in Figma, a key tool for creating user interfaces. This skill, combined with user persona knowledge, allowed me to design with empathy for the user.</li>
             <li>Coding and Development: I expanded my skill set by learning new programming languages and frameworks like Next.js. This allowed me to participate in website development and gain valuable teamwork experience.</li>
             <li>Confidence and Growth: I've developed coding confidence and a strong desire to continue learning.</li>
           </ul >
           <p>I encourage all the young girls to learn how to invest time to code and be involved in technology transformation. </p>
