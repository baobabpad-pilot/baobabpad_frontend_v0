          But first, let's clarify: What exactly is cloud computing? In simple
          terms, it's the delivery of computing services—such as servers,
          storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics—over the
          internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources,
          and economies of scale. Rather than owning physical hardware or
          infrastructure, businesses can access these services on-demand, paying
          only for what they use.
