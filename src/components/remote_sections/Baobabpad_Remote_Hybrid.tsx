          Handling Remote-Hybrid Culture: Juggling Face-to-Face and Online Work
          The adoption of a remote-hybrid work model, in which workers alternate
          between working from home and the office, brings with it both new
          opportunities and challenges for managing the culture of the
          organization. Deliberate measures are needed to maintain diversity,
