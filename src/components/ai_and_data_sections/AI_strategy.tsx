          AI is a very common term nowadays, different interpretations almost
          like an art. In the world of startups, two advantages make them stand
          out, being lightweight, and risk friendly. Startups can ship product
          without much bureaucracy. AI has joined the chat. Doesn't matter
          whether you are in Timbuktu or Athens or Sydney, if the code works, it
          works. Global product is global product.

          When we start with text, think about having a custom chat GPT for your
          own files - your own products, company statements, research papers and
          so much more. Low resourced languages for close to half a decade -
          bear in mind it's the tech world. African languages have been there.
          At present, which texts do you have in mind?

          Stable Diffusion and teams like Midjourney prove to us, ultramodern
          modern graphic design from futuristic to a mesh with legacy, it is all
          literally within the reach of our finger tips. Think about the graphic
          designer who now has more than a hundred variations of the room they
          took a picture of. Now that’s cool!

          With speech, gears change.If your clients can Alexa on your web
          application or mobile phone and it plays back in a different language,
          it seems like one for special documentaries. But now, it's all about
          the code, and that’s why we are here for you. The modules are speech
          to text, text encoding to instruction, response decoding to text,
          translated text, text to speech and voila!
        </p>
        <p>
          Now querying your email via speech, how is your startup not in the
          league of MAAN_ ( Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet)? How not?
          May AI Strategy be always in your favour.
