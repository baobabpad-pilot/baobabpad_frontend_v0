                    <p>
                        This reporting chain ensures that employees can report suspected or observed acts of corruption confidentially without fear of retaliation. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        1. Reporting Individual:
                        <br/><br/>
                        Any employee, contractor, or stakeholder who becomes aware of suspected corruption within Baobabpad.
                        <br/><br/>
                        2. Immediate Supervisor/Manager:
                        <br/><br/>
                        The reporting individual should initially report the concern to their immediate supervisor or manager. If the concern involves the immediate supervisor, the individual should proceed to the next level of management.
                        <br/><br/>
                        3. Department Head or Team Lead:
                        <br/><br/>
                        If the immediate supervisor is unable to address the concern or if they are involved in the issue, the reporting individual should escalate the matter to the relevant department head or team lead.
                        <br/><br/>
                        4. Human Resources Department:
                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        5. Legal and Compliance Department:<br/><br/>
                        If the HR department is unable to address the issue or if the reported concern involves a violation of legal or compliance standards, the matter should be escalated to the legal and compliance department.
                        <br/><br/>
                        6. Whistleblower Hotline or Reporting System:<br/><br/>
                        Baobabpad will provide a confidential whistleblower  reporting system for individuals who prefer to report concerns anonymously or who are uncomfortable using the internal reporting chain. This will be managed by a third-party service provider to ensure confidentiality.
                        <br/><br/>
                        7. Designated Compliance Officer:<br/><br/>
    
                        Baobabpad will appoint a designated compliance officer responsible for handling corruption reports. This individual will ensure the proper investigation of reported concerns and will coordinate with relevant departments to address the issue.
                        <br/><br/>
                        8. Executive Management:<br/><br/>
                        If the reported concern involves high-level executives or if the designated compliance officer needs additional support, the matter should be escalated to the executive management team.
                        <br/><br/>
                        9. Board of Directors or Audit Committee:<br/><br/>
                        In extreme cases where corruption involves executive management or where internal resolution is challenging, the matter can be escalated to the company's board of directors or audit committee.
                        <br/><br/>
                        10. External Authorities: <br/><br/>
                        If internal channels do not provide a resolution, or if the reported corruption involves a violation of the law, Baobabpad encourages the reporting individual to contact relevant external authorities, such as law enforcement agencies or government regulatory bodies.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It's crucial to emphasize that this reporting chain should be clearly communicated to all employees and stakeholders, and assurance should be given that those who report in good faith will be protected from any form of retaliation. Providing multiple reporting options, including an anonymous reporting system, enhances the likelihood of identifying and addressing corruption effectively.
                       <br/><br/>
                       The  approach is to never accept corruption, be it within the organization or within the collaborative projects receiving support.

                    <br/> <br/>The responsible Manager should as soon as suspicion of corruption or other irregularity has been reported or discovered write an event log. This log will be used when deciding on further actions together with the CEO, Founder and Board.
